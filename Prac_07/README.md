## Classes 2

This task was about further using classes to store definitions (functions) 
and be used in other python files :)
- Lesson 1: ALWAYS check which file you are running. I have tried to run the same file (not the current file 
i was working on) via a shortcut... All the changes I made seem to make no difference, so i continuously changed things 
around in my code and spent alot of time trying to fix the issue.... when I was not even running the file


- Lesson 2: dont procrastinate

- Lesson 3: rushing will not give you decent enough work
